PHPFIT
======

PHPFIT is a PHP5 port of the FIT acceptance test framework.
FIT was originally developed for Java by Ward Cunningham.

SYNOPSYS
--------

1) PHPFIT.php and PHPFIT/ must be in the PHP include path directory (as any PEAR package). 

2) Check the file 'phpfit-run' and change the first line according to the path of your PHP command-line interpreter (usually /usr/bin/php).

3) (optional) Create a symbolic link to 'phpfit-run'. e.g: ln -s /path/to/phpfit-run /usr/local/bin So you can run 'phpfit-run' from anywhere.

4) Run it:

4a) From the CLI:

phpfit-run path/to/input.html path/to/output.html [path/to/fixtures]

NOTE: [path/to/fixtures] is optional, by default it will check for fixtures in the include path and also relative to where you run 'phpfit-run'.

e.g: phpfit-run examples/input/arithmetic.html output.html

4b) From a Browser:

e.g: http://domain/path/to/phpfit/examples/run-web.php?input_filename=input/arithmetic.html

4c) From your own scripts:

<?php
require_once 'PHPFIT.php';

PHPFIT::run(input.html, output.html [, fixturesDirectory]);

echo file_get_contents(output.html);
?>


TODO
----

- PHPFIT::run(). Allow way to specify the output. eg: to a file, to stdout, etc.
- Achieve more tests coverage.
- It doesn't pass the FIT specification tests yet.
- Now works in Windows! (a phpfit-run.bat would be nice too)
- Document the code according to the PEAR standard!
